# Perceptron and Logic Gates
This repository contains a Python implementation of a perceptron, a basic unit in artificial neural networks, along with the training and testing of three logic gates: AND, OR, and NOT.

# Perceptron Class
The Perceptron class is implemented using NumPy and includes methods for activation and training. The perceptron is initialized with random weights, an activation threshold, and a learning rate. The activation method calculates the output based on the weighted sum of inputs, and the training method adjusts the weights to minimize the error.

# Logic Gates using Perceptrons
Perceptrons are utilized to implement AND, OR, and NOT gates. The gates are trained with specific input-output pairs to learn their respective behaviors.

# Training

# Testing
The test_perceptron function is used to test the behavior of each gate for different input combinations.
